# cd-ls
For those who are bored of typing ls after cd or something.

You know this urge to type ls after going in a new directory, I don't like it so I coded this. Here is the --help menu.

"To Use 'cls `<directory>`' instead of using 'source `<path-to-cls>` `<path-to-directory>`';

  "Edit '.bashrc' by adding  \"alias cls='source `<path>/cls`'\" which is a hidden file in '~/' by default"

"To change directory: 'source `<path-to-cls>` `<path-to-directory>`' (Also runs ls)."
"NOTE: You can use '.' or '..' too."

"To ls the current directory: 'cls'."
"NOTE: Just to ls, can't take any flags like -la."
"And here is the usage of the 'cd' command"
